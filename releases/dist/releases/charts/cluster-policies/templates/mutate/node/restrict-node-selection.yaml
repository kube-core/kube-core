      The Kubernetes scheduler uses complex logic to determine the optimal placement
      for new Pods. Users who have access to set certain fields in a Pod spec
      may sidestep this logic which in many cases is undesirable. This policy
      prevents users from targeting specific Nodes for scheduling of Pods by
      prohibiting the use of the `nodeName` fields.
