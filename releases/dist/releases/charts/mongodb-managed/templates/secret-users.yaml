  We can't generate a password dynamically here because the `lookup` function doesn't work for `helmfile diff` (or
  `helm diff upgrade`). That's a mess, but the solution here is to let `mittwald/kubernetes-secret-generator` generates 
  the password for us during the runtime. As well, Helm will not detect any difference.
